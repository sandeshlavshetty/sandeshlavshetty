### Who this is for
Recruiters looking for **Backend / Platform / API Engineers**.

I’m a **Backend & Platform Engineer** who builds **scalable APIs, reliable systems, and AI-powered services** used by thousands of users.

I’ve led the **end-to-end backend development** of a production-grade institutional platform serving **3,000+ users**, owning **API design, authentication, database architecture, DevOps, and security** from the ground up.

My experience spans **Python, FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, and PostgreSQL**, with a strong focus on **microservice-based architectures**, **asynchronous systems**, **concurrency**, and **cloud deployments**.

I also integrate **LLM-driven systems** into real-world products—designing **agentic workflows, recommendation engines, and automation pipelines** that reduce manual effort and enhance system intelligence.

I care deeply about **system reliability, clean abstractions, and performance**, and I enjoy turning complex requirements into **simple, maintainable, production-ready backend systems**.

### Who this is for
Recruiters hiring **AI / ML / Gen-AI Engineers**.

I’m an **AI / ML Engineer** focused on building **production-ready intelligent systems**, from classical machine learning models to **LLM-powered agentic applications**.

I’ve designed and deployed **AI/ML models** for recommendation, prediction, and automation, improving feature accuracy by **28%** and reducing manual intervention across real-world workflows.

My experience includes building **end-to-end ML pipelines**—data collection, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment—optimizing training workflows to reduce model training time by **35%**.

I actively work with **LLMs and agentic systems**, integrating models into production using **LangChain, LangGraph, vector databases, and OpenAI GPT models** to build **recommendation engines, automation pipelines, and AI-driven features**.

I care deeply about **model reliability, system performance, and real-world impact**, and I enjoy transforming complex AI ideas into **scalable, maintainable, production-grade AI systems**.
